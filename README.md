Tumblr Theme Journey

so this is my attempt at making hella cute themes for tumblr. 
Right now there is only the digighost theme, uses the artwork for the ASTRA album by Asia. 
I like the artwork, you can listen to them if you'd like.

the index and style files are just to be able to launch the html file on here. 
though that might not work with the new adjustments.
